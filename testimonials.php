                            I have been using Doctors' Management Service, Inc. (DMS) as my billing company for almost two years. I have practiced medicine for more than thirty years and have had the opportunity to use many billing companies. DMS stands out as the best, far and away. And this is for a number of reasons. Firstly, the people at the company are uniformly pleasant and helpful. Also, employees have specific responsibilities so you can always talk to the right person without going through an elaborate questioning process. Furthermore, the company is truly a full service company â€“ recently DMS helped with filling out an insurance provider application. Two months ago I was helped with a DME application. DMS is so much more than a billing company. And, of course, they do a great job billing and following up with outstanding bills. I recommend them highly and without reservation.

                          It is a pleasure working with Doctor's Management Services (DMS). They are one of the best and most organized companies that I have ever had the opportunity to experience.  A fantastic and supportive group of individuals who really care about what you do and the role they perform in your business. Clear, concise and informative billing services that help you understand how to take the work that you are performing and bringing it to the next level so you are being reimbursed accurately. They are always willing to go the extra mile and I highly recommend them.

                            When I closed my solo surgical office practice and semi-retired, I realized that I would still need a billing service, as previously my secretary had done the billing. I decided to sign-up with DMS because they came highly recommended. Tim Di Bona and his staff have not disappointed. They are professional, competent, and polite and they answer all phone calls and e-mails promptly. Although I am a small account, I feel that I receive their full attention when needed. Particularly, the staff is persistent and successful when tracking down out-standing insurance payments. DMS would be the perfect fit for any practice, large or small, that requires a dependable, professional, up to date billing and management service.

                            It gives me great pleasure to write this recommendation for Tim. I have known Tim for a very long time and have been fortunate enough to work with him over the last few years on a professional level as a business partner within the Salus Resource Group.
                        <br><br>
                        The idea behind the Salus Resource Group is to bring a group of varied professionals together that provide comprehensive solutions for the medical and dental community. From the inception of the idea, Tim quickly emerged as the leader among our group. Tim has the ability to transition from a technical role to a management role where appropriate. The skill to "bridge the gap" between the technical and the functional make him an excellent business facilitator. In addition, Tim always displayed excellent communication and leadership skills, which resulted in a highly functional team who accomplished a tremendous amount of quality work in very short timelines.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, Tim has been a tremendous contributor to the success of the Salus Resource Group and always works with the highest level of honesty and integrity. He is also a great listener and a caring and compassionate individual that is always concerned with the needs of others.
                        <br><br>
                        The quality of his work coupled with his outstanding character consistently exceeds expectations. I give Tim my highest recommendation for any endeavor he may pursue, without reservation.</q>

                            Tim has provided the highest level of service that our doctor clients could ask for! DMS' medical billing services are best in class. The team at Doctors' Management Service is friendly, professional, and dedicated to helping physicians and dentists to maximize reimbursements. If you are a physician or dentist, managing your own billing, I would recommend that you have a talk with Tim. Keep up the great work Tim and DMS!!!</q>

The staff are pro-active, courteous and always helpful in answering my questions. They go above and beyond by customizing and tailoring my reports to my practice while at the same time working tirelessly to ensure maximum reimbursement in a legal and ethical manner. Their dedication, experience and success allow me to focus on my practice by relieving me of the day to day burdens of the business side. I can do this because I have the confidence that DMS is working hard for me and in my best interest. I can have as much or as little involvement as I want â€“ itâ€™s like having an in house business manager and billing department all for a relatively low flat rate. I have and will continue to recommend DMS to my colleagues for all of their medical billing and business support needs.</q></p>

                                I have had the personal experience of working with Doctors' Management Service for over ten years as my billing service. I am very pleased to let you know, as I have said many times in the past, that you have highly trained and professional people working courteously and efficiently.<br>
                            <br>
                            It is amazing to see that a relatively small
                            company like yours is very proficient and well
                            organized compared to that of larger billing
                            corporations. Your business should grow to a state
                            wide or even a nation wide emergency billing
                            service.<br>
                            <br>
                            I was impressed with your input knowledge and great
                            stride to work with a great interest in resolving
                            problems and issues. In the past I have sent a
                            handwritten letter and memo from Dr. Geller from
                            the Emergency Department at Norwood Hospital with
                            almost no billing complaints out of approximately
                            50,000 plus billing charts by your company.<br>
                            <br>
                            I wish you all the best and hope that your company
                            grows. Congratulations on doing excellent work.</q>

                            For more than five years, they have been taking
                            care of the billing for our Hospitalist group at
                            Caritas Norwood Hospital. They are very prompt,
                            responsive, and proactive. They are able to
                            accomodate all of our requests for reports,
                            information, and staff training. Most importantly,
                            DMS has worked alongside us to keep improving our
                            billing systems and performance. Without DMS as a
                            partner in our endeavor, I think our overall

                                I was associated with Doctors' Management Service
                            for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, when our Emergency
                            Medicine group became employees. My experiences
                            with the entire staff were exemplary. Their
                            organization provided constant useful feedback and
                            guidance regarding each physician's documentation
                            skills and weaknesses. This allowed us to maximize
                            our collections and constantly improve. We were
                            apprised promptly of changes we needed to make when
                            Medicare or other insurers abruptly changed the
                            rules. Individual "one on one" attention was easy
                            to obtain and all staff members were attentive,
                            patient, and clear in their instruction and
                            guidance. The doors were always open. I don't
                            believe it is possible to get a better billing
                            service for an Emergency Medical Group. I recommend
                            them highly.</q>

                            <q>I am a cardiothoracic surgeon and spend most of my

                            assist colleagues on thoracic cases that might be

                            <q>It is my pleasure to write a recommendation for
                            Doctors' Management billing services. I have had experience with Doctors' Management Service Inc
                            over the past 16 years and have found the company
                            to be honest, efficient and highly effective. The
                            service provided by Doctors' Management is
                            responsive and personal. I have always observed
                            that they exercise appropriate sensitivity to both the physicians' interests and any patient concerns. Prior to my practice at Norwood, I had the opportunity to oversee the billing for a very large and successful emergency practice. While doing so,
                            I have had the chance to interview and review many
                            of the billing options available both in and out of state. I believe too often choices are based on the size of the company or the magnitude of their fee
                            rather than dollars collected per patient. My
                            experience is that Doctors' Management is
                            unsurpassed in delivering on dollars per patient. I
                            highly recommend Doctors' Management Service for
                            emergency medicine billing and I feel strongly that
                            an alternate choice would be a costly commitment to
                            mediocrity.</q>

                            <q>I have worked with Barbara and Richard DiBona and
                            their company, Doctors' Management Service, Inc.,
                            since becoming a self-employed Emergency Physician
                            in 1995. I had recently finished my residency and
                            had been a salaried employee until that time. I,
                            like many of my colleagues, knew nothing about the
                            complexities of medical billing. Thanks to the
                            DiBona's I now have an infinitely better
                            understanding of the business of medical billing.
                            The DiBona's are very thorough and knowledgeable
                            about all aspects of billing. They stay abreast of
                            the latest billing trends and insurance changes
                            that might affect my income. They use state of the
                            art computers and software to process my claims
                            quickly and efficiently. Because of their
                            investment in the latest technology, my turn around
                            time on reimbursement is excellent. When visiting
                            the office, the staff is always professional and
                            pleasant. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the
                            years of service I have received from Doctors'
                            Management Service Inc. and I highly recommend
                            Barbara and Richard DiBona for all of your billing
                            needs.</q>

                            my billing agent for over ten years and couldn't be
                            more pleased. They have been diligent with billing
                            and collections, and have helped me and my

                            They are a top tier service which is well worth

                            <q>I am writing this letter in support of Dick and
                            Barbara DiBona of Doctors' Management Service who
                            were the preferred billing service from 1987
                            through 1999 while I was the Director of Emergency
                            Services at Southwood and Norwood Hospitals. During
                            this time Doctors' Management were billing up to
                            40,000 patients per year. When I relinquished the
                            Director position in 1999, the DiBona's continued
                            to be voted in annually as the ER group's billing
                            service. The DiBona's have proved to be meticulous
                            in their bookkeeping, knowledgeable of billing
                            practices, and responsive to a diverse group of
                            physicians' information requests. The DiBona's have
                            often provided data that resulted in better
                            physician documentation, leading to improved
                            physician practice and increased revenue. The
                            DiBona's ongoing efforts to educate the physicians
                            regarding the federal government's requirements for
                            patient histories and physical exams have had
                            significant impact on group practice. Doctors'
                            Management has integrated their billing practice
                            and the physician's clinical practice seamlessly.
                            Dick and Barbara are hard working, their integrity
                            is unquestioned, and I highly recommend their

                            <q>DMS is owned and operated by the DiBona family and
                            is a relatively small business in comparison to
                            other local companies which our group has known.
                            Although many could consider this a disadvantage, I
                            would strongly disagree. During this time, I have
                            become personally acquainted with the DiBona's and
                            find that I have the ability to personally discuss
                            my account with an individual who is intimately
                            knowledgeable about the details of my account. I
                            have compared results of my returns and general
                            level of satisfaction with other ED directors in
                            the area. I have found that these returns (in
                            comparable payer mix areas) and the high level of
                            prompt, personal service are clearly superior in
                            every regard. Indeed, I have been contacted on a
                            number of occasions by DMS with suggestions about
                            my documentation to maximize revenues, to which I
                            am entitled. This level of attention is foreign to
                            those individuals in groups using large companies.
                            In summary, as an emergency department physician
                            and director, my role is to provide the best health
                            care possible. My expectation for the reimbursement
                            of these services is also extremely high. DMS
                            delivers on this expectation and I recommend them
                            to you enthusiastically. I would be happy to
                            discuss any questions that you may have about DMS.</q>
