<p>Our Senior Coder has worked in the industry for over 30 years. She has served on our team for 20 years. Our other coding specialists have received the necessary certificate training and in-house training to become experts in the field. Our team even provides Documentation Training (you can read more about that on our Services page). With Doctorsâ€™ Management Service, you may choose between several methods of chart coding. We will design superbill checklists to prioritize quality and efficiency that works best for your operation.</p>
    <p>Our coders are not only trained to simply push your encounters through, but they analyze your documents and provide feedback for services you may not be billing properly. Some of our specialists have received compliance training and can perform in-house audits to prevent you from paying the high costs of outsourcing that service. All of these services are provided complimentary in the Full Medical Billing package but may also be performed separately if you wish. Please contact us for our current rates to code your encounters.</p></div></div>
