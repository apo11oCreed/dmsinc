        <p>Too often we knew professionals who complained about credentialing companies taking 6 months or more to complete the process for providers. In the early years of our business we realized these companies did not understand the urgency and importance of complete credentialing. Too often, a companyâ€™s staff would sit idle if a provider did not return a packet. Our staff does not follow the reactive model. We make sure all papers are signed in a timely manner. This is a skill position that demands experience and a hands-on department to aggressively push forward. Our credentialing personnel are always hard at work setting up your contracts with insurance companies. We will swiftly re-credential all existing providers and all new providers you add along the way. It is essential to have a very knowledgeable and experienced team working on your account. One mistake will lead to months of lost revenue. Our credentialing department works on every account we currently bill for. This is an invaluable asset, which is especially needed at the genesis of our relationship.</p>
    <p>Although this service is currently included as a complimentary service in our Full Medical Billing package, you may opt for our team to perform credentialing-only for your practice.</p></div></div>
