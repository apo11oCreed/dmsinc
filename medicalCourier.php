<p>Your charts and patients' privacy are extremely important to you and we promise to follow all HIPAA standards in protecting your information. These days there are many options to transmit your encounters. You may feel one is more safe or professional than another. Whether you feel more comfortable using secure email, EHR, shared web storage, or secure fax, we will meet your needs. If you do not feel comfortable sending your charts electronically, we are always willing to send a medical courier on a regular basis to add an extra level of security to your account.</p>
<p>Our courier has worked in the medical field for over 10 years and has been trained in HIPAA regulations. All encounters are taken directly to our physical office for delivery, straight from your office. They are stored in a locked area at all times during transport.</p></div></div>
