<h1>Documentation Training</h1>
<p>How confident do you feel that everyone in your practice is accurately billing for every service they provide? Every year the rules for coding change. ICD-9 diagnosis specificity requirements update frequently. Service codes change just as often. Diminished or non-payment for utilizing defunct codes can be a death knell for many practices. How are you supposed to keep up with the changes? When you hire a new member to your practice, how do you ensure they understand the difference between levels of billing? What are the chances that you are performing reimbursable procedures, for which you are not submitting for payment?</p>

<p>Most practices leave significant money on the table due to a lack of proper training. Many groups are unknowingly exposed to the consequences of failing an insurance audit of their account. Do not worry about these issues. Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with the benefit of having a high quality practice. Our coding experts will meet with you and your group members one-on-one AND in group presentations. We use your own charts to identify the weaknesses of your team members. We will even perform our own compliance audit of your group, run under the accepted rules and regulations that the insurance companies follow. This service is complimentary with our Full Medical Billing option but also purchasable as a stand-alone service.</p></div></div>
