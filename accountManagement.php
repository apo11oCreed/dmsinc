        <p>There is nothing more important to our clients than having the ability to hold their finger on the pulse of their business. We always hear complaints such as “My last biller was impossible to get on the phone” or “I’m surprised you invited me to your office. I was with my last company for over 10 years without even an invitation.” Those days are over.</p>
<p>You will be given an account manager that has proven to be a long term employee who can be trusted with the demand of account management. We do not hire account managers from the outside. Our managers have worked on accounts in our office for many years before they are granted the responsibility to deal with you one-on-one. This person will be available to you during our business hours at all times. If you need to speak to someone on a holiday or off normal hours, you will be presented with a cell phone number for emergencies. If an issue is important but not an emergency, your emails will be answered first thing the next morning (although some of our account managers are likely to check email at home and answer you the same evening or on the weekend). So, you now have 24 hour billing and management coverage. You will have a single main contact to funnel all questions and concerns through. Your manager will never be changed on you.</p></div>
