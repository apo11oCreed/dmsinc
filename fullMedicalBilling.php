<p>Our techniques are legal, ethical, and aggressive. Over 25 years of billing experience has allowed us to become experts through our hands-on approach with accounts in the past. We understand the intricacies of the medical billing business world and will use that knowledge to maximize the reimbursement you deserve for your hard work. We do not simply fight every denial of payment we receive. We will analyze your practice and perform a SWAT analysis to determine what is needed to optimize your performance. We will not simply bill your work but we will ensure all of your encounters are captured and prepared properly. We will submit our advice whenever it is prudent. We will be proactive in setting up your account in ways which our competitors do not have the workforce to commit to.</p>
<p>Our staff is always keeping up to date with the latest news, technology, and regulations and we will pass them on to you. What are the risks and benefits to adopting an Electronic Health Reocord? What happens if I am audited by Medicare? Is now the time to join an ACO? Which ACO would be right for my practice? How can I cash in on quality incentives? We hear these questions and many more from our clients all the time. You may not have the time or resources to keep up to date with everything. Worry no more; we are here to help put your business concerns to rest once and for all.</p></div></div>
