<p>Do you suspect that your current billing is inadequate? Have your finances stagnated at the same rate for years or worse yet, decreased? With decades of billing knowledge, our team will investigate your current group billing model and supply recommendations for improving your current practice. We will not perform this service to benefit ourselves or try to convince you to utilize our billing service. We understand the difficulty in making the decision to switch billing companies. If there is an opportunity to improve your result with a quick fix, we will furnish the recommendations following our analysis. Contracts with insurance, inter-department qualms, and aged accounts will be targeted first. We will determine the best recommendations to streamline the cash flow of your account and present you with all legal and ethical options so you can customize the vision of your practice.</p></div></div>
