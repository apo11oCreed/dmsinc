<h1>Compliance Auditing</h1>
<p>Some of our coders have been trained to perform in-house audits of your charts. Our team will seek and identify any and all weaknesses your providers have. We prefer to start the process with Documentation Consultations and use the auditing service to turn a good documentarian into a great one. Passing our Documentation Consultation is not a prerequisite however. We will perform audits on any member of your practice.</p>

<p>Our auditing is included in our Full Medical Billing package but also may be provided at a standard rate per encounter based on total quantity of encounters and specialty of the provider. We are also able to customize our audit to report on the findings in which you are most interested. We understand that every practice has a different philosophy and we will help you reach your compliance goals.</p></div></div>
